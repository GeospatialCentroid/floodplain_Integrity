# floodplain_Integrity
Code base for the development of a CONUS level floodplain integrity stressor density analysis. Completed in collaboration with Kira Simonson and Ryan Morrison.



## Description 
Functions generate percent area measurements, total number of features, and total length/area of features within a given watershed. All methods were applied across the 88,000ish huc units in CONUS. This lead to some computationally intensive spatial operations. 
While the project is completed (datasets delivered) this code base will be of practicle use going forward and should be considered for more generalized and optimized development. For example 

- Calculate the percent area of a categorical raster within a given polygon object 
- Calcualte the total area of a polygon within another polygon object.
